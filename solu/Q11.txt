"""An anagram of a word is a word that is created by rearranging the letters of the original.
For instance, two anagrams of idle are deli and lied. Finding anagrams that are real words is
beyond our reach until Chapter 12.

Instead, write a program that asks the user for a string
and returns a random anagram of the stringâ€”in other words, a random rearrangement of the
letters of that string."""

solution:

from random import shuffle
word = input('Enter a word: ')
new_word = list(word)
shuffle(new_word)
new_word_2 = ''.join(new_word)
print(new_word_2)


Explain
1.from random import shuffle: This line imports the shuffle function from the random module. The shuffle function is used to randomly shuffle the elements of a list.
2.word = input('Enter a word: '): This line prompts the user to enter a word and stores the input in the variable word.
3.new_word = list(word): This line converts the input word into a list of its characters. This step is necessary because the shuffle function works with lists, not strings.
4.shuffle(new_word): This line shuffles the list of characters randomly. After this line executes, the elements of new_word will be in a random order.
5.new_word_2 = ''.join(new_word): This line joins the shuffled characters back into a single string. The join function concatenates each element of the list new_word into a single string, with an empty string '' between each character. This effectively creates a new string with the characters rearranged randomly.
6.print(new_word_2): This line prints the randomly rearranged string, which is the random anagram of the original word entered by the user.



So, in summary, this program takes a word input from the user, shuffles its characters to create a random anagram, and then prints the result.
