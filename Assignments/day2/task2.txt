Task 1: Flowchart Creation - Design a flowchart that outlines the logic for a user login process. It should include conditional paths for successful and unsuccessful login attempts, and a loop that allows a user three attempts before locking the account.

Solution: Flowchart for User Login Process
Flowchart:

Start

Input username and password

If username and password are correct:
    Display "Login successful"
    End
Else:
    Increment login attempts
    If login attempts < 3:
        Display "Incorrect username or password. Please try again."
        Go back to Input username and password
    Else:
        Display "Maximum login attempts reached. Account locked."
        End

End
Explanation:
The user is prompted to input their username and password.
If the username and password match, the login is successful.
If not, the system checks the number of login attempts.
If the attempts are less than 3, the user is prompted again.
If attempts reach 3, the account is locked.
